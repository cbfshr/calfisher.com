			My Interests
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			I'm an Iowan, born and raised, ready to explore the world. I graduated from High School in
			2012 and began my studies at Iowa State University in the Fall of 2012. Since this is my junior year, I only have 3 semesters
			until graduation in May of 2016. Some of my general interests include soccer, racquet-ball, and travelling.

			Technical Interests
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			I find a number of technical areas interesting, but the most significant would be embedded systems and user interface design.
			I also have a hobby of web design (although I spend so much time trying to perfect my sites that they're almost never finished),
			including ASP.NET and single-page applications (SPA) (see Aptlyfe in Projects). Graphics design (with Adobe Illustrator) is another area that I tend
			to spend some of my hobby time doing. Having at least some graphics experience makes projects more exciting because it adds
			a more creative aspect.

			CprE 185 Teaching Assistant
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			Currently, I am working as a teaching assistant (TA) for Computer Engineering 185 (CprE 185), an introductory engineering course
			which aims to introduce the students to programming and problem solving with the C language. This is my third semester of
			being a TA for the class (Fall 2014). The benefits of being a TA are endless; continued practice and review of the C programming
			language, seeing and hearing how the students approach different problems, and learning how to effectively express my own thoughts
			in a way that will help the student understand a certain concept.

			DuPont Pioneer Software Development Intern
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			During the Summer of 2014 (May 12th - August 7th), I worked at DuPont Pioneer in Johnston, Iowa as a Software Development Intern.
			I was put on a team responsible for certain applications used by agronomists, field managers, and temporary works in crop fields.
			These applications were web-based and geared towards being used mainly on tablet-sized touch screens. The purpose of the apps were
			to expedite and ease the process which the workers had to go through in order to inspect fields and save their observations.
