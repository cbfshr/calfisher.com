					Currently, I am working as a teaching assistant (TA) for Computer Engineering 185 (CprE 185), an introductory engineering course
					which aims to introduce the students to programming and problem solving with the C language. This is my fourth semester of
					being a TA for the class.
					<br />
					<br />
					The benefits of being a TA are endless; continued practice and review of the C programming
					language, seeing and hearing how the students approach different problems, and learning how to effectively express my own thoughts
					in a way that will help the student understand a multitude of programming or engineering concepts.

					During the Summer of 2014 (May 12th - August 7th), I worked at DuPont Pioneer in Johnston, Iowa as a Software Development Intern.
					I was put on a team responsible for certain applications used by agronomists, field managers, and temporary workers in crop fields.
					These applications were web-based and geared towards being used mainly on tablet-sized touch screens (iPads). The purpose of the apps was
					to expedite the process of inspecting fields and saving their observations.
