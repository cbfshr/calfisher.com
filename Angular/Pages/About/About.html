					Currently, I am working as a teaching assistant (TA) for Computer Engineering 185 (CprE 185), an introductory engineering course
					which aims to introduce the students to programming and problem solving with the C language. This is my fourth semester of
					being a TA for the class.
					<br />
					<br />
					The benefits of being a TA are endless; continued practice and review of the C programming
					language, seeing and hearing how the students approach different problems, and learning how to effectively express my own thoughts
					in a way that will help the student understand a multitude of programming or engineering concepts.

					At the Olathe, KS headquarters of Garmin, I worked for the Automotive department as a member of the Speech Technologies - Voices team.
					In this position, I worked closely with code on PNDs (personal navigation devices) that support many languages. A majority of the code
					is written in C; however, I utilized Python for parsing files related to phrase generation. Part of my internship was spent on fixing
					small bugs in the code, rewriting inneficient code, and implementing new logging functionality.

					During the Summer of 2014, I worked at DuPont Pioneer in Johnston, Iowa as a Software Development Intern.
					I was put on a team responsible for applications used by agronomists, field managers, and temporary workers in crop fields.
					These applications were web-based and were used mainly on tablet-sized touch screens (iPads). The purpose of the apps was
					to expedite the process of inspecting corn fields and saving their observations. I learned a lot about the software development process,
					including working closely with the supervisor (project client) to ensure that the software meets specifications. The project was
					written in C#.NET, HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript framework called AngularJS. I also worked on maintaining database entries and 
					stored procedures with SQL.
