					The basic idea of DrawNear is to have the ability to draw a picture, upload it, and let others nearby see it!
					<br />
					<br />
					On the right is a screenshot of the Map screen, which shows locations of drawings around the user (markers shown as pencils).
					A user can click on any of these to view a small preview of the drawing.
