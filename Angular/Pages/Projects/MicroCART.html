					My responsibilities on the team include: Web Master and Ground Station Software. As Web Master,
					my job is to create and maintain a website that serves as a hub for all information about the
					project including Weekly Reports, Project Plans, and other important documents. The
					Ground Station Software is the software that runs on a computer with a Bluetooth connection to
					the quadcopter. This software is written in C and C++ (Qt) and is responsible for receiving information
					from a camera system (position coordinates), sending commands to the quadcopter, and logging information
					received from the quadcopter.
