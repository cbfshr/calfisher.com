          Quadroid is a unique team project that consists of a Syma X11
          Quadcopter, an Arduino board, and a Nexus 7 Android tablet. The
          ambitious end goal of the project was to be able to control the
          quadcopter with the Nexus 7 tablet.

          The way we went about it was like this: we first needed to
          reverse-engineer the default RF controller for the quadcopter. Next,
          we needed to be able to emulate electrical signals that would normally
          be determined by the resistance of the joysticks. We connected wires
          to the Arduino board and directly soldered the other end of the wires
          to the controller's circuit board where the joysticks previously were.

          The picture to the left shows the wiring between the Arduino and
          controller circuit board.

          On the other end of the spectrum, the Android application needed to do
          two things: emulate two joysticks and send the input information to
          the Arduino (using the Arduino Mega ADK). (Pictured to the left)
          <br>
          <br>
          From there, the Arduino could send the correct signals to the
          controller, which would then control the quadcopter.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once we got it working 100%, we were able to add a second flight mode
          to the Android application which allowed us to fly the quadcopter by
          controlling the roll and pitch with theaccelerometer values on the
          Android tablet. (Pictured to the right)

          The project worked surprisingly well, and we went above and beyond the
          minimum requirements by implementing such a complex,
          reverse-engineered system.
